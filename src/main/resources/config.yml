# Radius is number of blocks outward from that point
# clamp-to-limits makes sure the values don't fall outside valid areas, suggest to always have enabled
# If multiverse or essentials is enabled, -1 location values will use the spawn point in those plugins. Otherwise -1
# uses the vanilla/base game spawn point location.
# Please take into account that if the result of doing "y center" - "y range" is lower than 0, players will be able to
# spawn below bedrock and fall into the void.

# Should the list above contain blocks that should be considered safe?

# The amount of air block needed for a location to be seen as safe.
# Default: 2 (recommended).
air gap above: 2

# When searching for a spawn range, do we start from the top of the world or
# the bottom.
# The normal behaviour is starting from the top which puts players on the
# highest block where the sky is visible.
# Alternatively, if we start from the bottom, players will spawn in the lowest
# blocks possible (often in the deepest caves).
top to bottom: true

# If set to true, and the surface block is not ok (such as lakes) it will
# continue to try to find a safe block (like caves under the lake)
# Defaults to false.
# WARNING: if this is set to false and the y values are higher than 256, it will constantly fail
# to find a safe location. You will recognize in console when this happens, messages saying "No non-air block found".

#  Spawning   #
###############

# Should players be teleported to a new location when respawning?
spawn on death: true

# Should players be teleported to a new location when first joining the server?
spawn on first join: true

# Should players be teleported to their bed when respawning? This will be ignored if they don't have a bed.
spawn on bed: true

# Should players need a permission node for being randomly teleported? This will only affect automatic random
# spawning. random spawn command needs a different permission. The permission node for this settings is
# "areaSpawner.automatic"
use permission: false

###############
# Essentials  #
###############

# Should players be teleported to home instead of random spawn on-death
essentials home teleport: true

# Should AreaSpawner set the user's Essentials home 'home' on first-join
# random spawn?
essentials home on first spawn: true

# The name to give to the new home when players first join the server and get randomly teleported
# with "essentials home on first spawn" set to true.
home on first spawn name: 'home'

###############
#   Caching   #
###############

# Should AreaSpawner get some spawn locations and save them to use them when the moment comes?
# HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to be enabled.
# If disabled, AreaSpawner will try to generate a new safe spawn location on the spot
# every time one is needed (not recommended).
enable cache: true

# When the plugin is disabled or the server closes, sould AreaSpawner saves what was saved in the cache
# to a cache file (cache.yml) to then be loaded when the plugin is enabled again?
save cache to file: true

# The amount of time to wait in between locations when generating locations for the cache.
# T -> Ticks; S -> Seconds; M -> Minutes; H -> Hours; D -> Days.
# If the unit is not T,S,M,H or D, it will count as S (seconds).
# Any other incorrect input will be detected as 3S (3 seconds).
time between generating locations: 3S

# The amount of time to wait in between each attempt to generate a single location.
# T -> Ticks; S -> Seconds; M -> Minutes; H -> Hours; D -> Days.
# If the unit is not T,S,M,H or D, it will count as T (ticks).
# Any other incorrect input will be detected as 5T (5 ticks).
time between location attempts: 5T

# Number of spawns to calculate and save in the cache.
# The amount of spawns should not affect your server performance since spawn calculation is made async.
# The bigger your server, the more locations in cache you want, sometimes it's not necessary to have loads of locations
# in memory ready to be used, if you have a server with 25 players, rarely those 25 players will die at the same time.
# Recommended is 2*(player base).
amount of cached spawns: 10

# Number of attempts to calculate a safe location until giving up and calculating the next one.
safe spawn attempts: 25

# When a spawnpoint is used, should AreaSpawner remove this location?
# Recommended if: the amount of cache spawns is not very high or you just don't want the possibility for
# a player to spawn close to where another player spawned at all.
# It is also recommended to have "replace location on remove" set to true if this is also set to true.
delete location on use: false

# When a location is removed, should AreaSpawn create a new safe location in its place?
replace location on remove: true

# When a location that was previously considered safe but it is no longer safe
# should AreaSpawner delete them and generate a new one or just not use it?
# Definitely recommended.
delete location on unsafe: true

# Should AreaSpawner check for safety anyways even though it's been cached
# when attempting to spawn players at a cache entry.
# Highly recommended as the location could have become unsafe since it was
# last cached.
re-check for safety on use: true


##################
# travel command #
##################

# Should the "/travel" command be enabled for players to use?
# Requires "areaSpawner.travel" permission.
travel enabled: true

# How much time between "/travel" uses? Set to 0 disable.
# S -> Seconds; M -> Minutes; H -> Hours; D -> Days.
# Any incorrect input will be detected as 0s (disabled)
# Permission to bypass cooldowns is "areaSpawner.cooldown.bypass"
travel cooldown: 10S

# Will remove "areaSpawner.travel" permission from players that run the "/travel" command successfully.
# Requires Vault.
remove permission on travel: false

# How much will a player be charged in order to run the "/travel" command successfully?
# Set to 0 to disable. Requires Vault and an economy plugin to be installed on the server.
# You can also opt-to instead use my MPCommandSettings plugin to have command charges and cooldowns
# all in one place. spigotmc.org/resources/mp-command-settings.72098
travel cost: 0.0

# Will set an Essentials home on the traveled location if none set for the player before.

# Will set an Essentials home on the traveled location if none set for the player before.
